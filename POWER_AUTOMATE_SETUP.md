   ```javascript
   const powerAutomateUrl = 'YOUR_POWER_AUTOMATE_URL_HERE';
   ```
3. Replace with your actual URL:
   ```javascript
   const powerAutomateUrl = 'https://prod-XX.westeurope.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/xxxxx...';
   ```

4. Save the file and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Added Power Automate integration for pricing forms"
   git push
   ```

## Step 8: Test It!

1. Visit your deployed landing page
2. Scroll to the pricing section
3. Click "I'd Pay This" on any pricing tier
4. Fill in the form and submit
5. Check your Excel file in OneDrive - the data should appear!
6. Check your email (if you set up notifications)

## Troubleshooting

### Data not appearing in Excel?
- Make sure your Excel table is properly formatted
- Check that column names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify the flow ran successfully in Power Automate (check Run history)

### Getting CORS errors?
- Power Automate HTTP triggers should handle CORS automatically
- Make sure you're using the full URL including all parameters

### Flow not triggering?
- Check the Run history in Power Automate
- Look for errors in browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
- Verify the URL is copied correctly

---

## What Data You'll Collect

For each submission, you'll capture:
- **Timestamp**: When they submitted
- **Email**: User's email address
- **Name**: Optional first name
- **Tier**: supporter / family / extended / Custom
- **Price**: The price point they selected ($4.99, $9.99, $14.99, or custom)
- **Source**: Whether from "Reservation Form" or "Custom Price Form"

---

## Next Steps

Once you have data flowing:
1. **Analyze price sensitivity**: Which tiers get most selections?
2. **Calculate average WTP**: Especially from custom prices
3. **Track conversion funnel**: Compare pricing clicks to actual reservations
4. **Follow up**: Email people who showed interest at specific price points

---

## Security Note

The HTTP URL contains authentication tokens. **Keep it private!** Don't commit it to public repositories. Consider:
- Using environment variables
- Adding the URL to `.gitignore` if you create a config file
- Regenerating the URL if it gets exposed

---

## Questions?

If you run into issues:
1. Check Power Automate's **Run history** to see what's failing
2. Look at browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify your Excel table structure matches the field names

Good luck! ðŸš€
